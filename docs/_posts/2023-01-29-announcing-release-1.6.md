Today I am pleased to announce the sixth release of Kubernetes Pi Cluster project (v1.6). 

Main features/enhancements of this release are:

## GitOps methodology adoption (ArgoCD)

In previous releases Ansible were used not only to configure cluster nodes OS and install K3S, but also to deploy Kubernetes applications in an imperative way, through the sequiential execution of installation/configuration commands (`helm install` and `kubectl apply -f`) contained in Ansible playbooks/roles and all helm chart values files and manifests needed to be applied in form of jinja2 templates.

In this new release, deployment of Kuberentes applications is completely managed by [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/), being Git repository the single source of truth for helm charts configuration files and kubernetes manifest. Kubernetes applications keep synch with manifest files stored in Git repository, enabling the implementation of a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline.

The automation source code has been completely refactored:
- New packaged Kubernetes applications, in form of  helm charts or sets of manifest files, have been developed, so they can be deployed with ArgoCD.
- Changes in Ansible automation code to automatically boot the cluster using ArgoCD
- Remove old ansible code to deploy Kuberentes applications

Check further details about [ArgoCD installation and configuration](/docs/argocd/) in the documentation and the new [Quick Start Instructions](/docs/ansible/).

## New Secrets Management solution (Hashicorp Vault)

Related to the previous feature, a Secret Management tool has been integrated in the cluster to maanage the creation of secrets needed by the Cluster Applications.  

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is used now as Secret Management solution for Raspberry PI cluster. All cluster secrets (users, passwords, api tokens, etc) are securely encrypted and stored in Vault.

Vault is deployed as a external service, not runing as Kuberentes application. [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/) is used to automatically generate the Kubernetes Secrets from Vault data that Kubernetes applications could need.

Cluster bootstrap process, using Ansible, takes care of the installation and configuration of Hashicorp Vault and the initial load of secrets needed by the cluster applications.

Check further details in [Vautl Installation doc](/docs/vault/).

## From Monitoring to Observability platform

Move from a Monitoring platform, based on Prometheus (metrics) and EFK (logs) to a Observability Platform adding traces monitoring and a single plane of glass.

New observability solution based on [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) (logs), [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) (traces), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (metrics) and Grafana as single plane of glass for monitoring.

Main features:

- Grafana Loki as complement of the available EFK platform, not a replacement. ES is used mainly for Log Analytics (log content is completely indexed) while Loki can be used for Observability (only log labels are indexed) having together logs, metrics and traces in the same Grafana Dashboards.

- Common logs collection/distrution layer based on fluentbit/fluentd is used to feed logs to ES and to Loki, instead of deploying a separate collector ([Loki promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/))

- Grafana Tempo as distributed tacing solution integrating [Linkerd distributed tracing](https://linkerd.io/2.11/tasks/distributed-tracing/) capability.
