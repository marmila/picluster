{{site.data.alerts.note}}

Metal LB load balancer can be replaced by Cilium's LB-IPAM capability, if Cilium CNI is installed in the cluster. See [Cilium installation doc](/docs/cilium/)

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Instead of using the embeded service load balancer that only comes with K3S, kippler-lb, a more generic kubernetes load balancer like [Metal LB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) will be used. This load balancer can be used with almost any distribution of kubernetes.

In order to use Metal LB, K3S embedded Klipper Load Balancer must be disabled: K3s server installation  option `--disable servicelb`.

After K3S fresh installation disabling embedded service load balanced, the following pods and services are started by default:

```shell
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

kubectl get services --all-namespaces

```

## Why Metal LB

Kubernetes does not offer an implementation of network load balancers (Services of type LoadBalancer) for bare-metal clusters. The implementations of network load balancers that Kubernetes does ship with are all glue code that calls out to various IaaS platforms (GCP, AWS, Azure…).

In bare-metal kubernetes clusters, like the one I am building, "LoadBalancer" services will remain in the “pending” state indefinitely when created. See in previous output of `kubectl get services` command how `traefik` LoadBAlancer service "External IP" is "pending".

For Bare-metal cluster only two optios remain availale for managing incoming traffic to the cluster: “NodePort” and “externalIPs” services. Both of these options have significant downsides for production use, which makes bare-metal clusters second-class citizens in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

MetalLB provides a network load balacer that can be integrated with standard network equipment, so that external services on bare-metal clusters can be accesible using a pool of "external" ip addresses.

## How Metal LB works

MetalLB can work in two modes, BGP and Layer 2. The major advantage of the layer 2 mode is its universality: it will work on any Ethernet network. In BGP mode specific routers are needed to deploy the solution.

In [layer 2 mode](https://metallb.universe.tf/concepts/layer2/), one node assumes the responsibility of advertising a particular kuberentes service (LoadBalance type) to the local network, this is call the `leader` node. From the network’s perspective, it simply looks like that node has multiple IP addresses assigned to its network interface and it just responds to ARP requests for IPv4 services, and NDP requests for IPv6.

When configuring MetalLB in layer 2 mode, all traffic for a service IP goes to the leader node. From there, kube-proxy spreads the traffic to all the service’s pods. Thus MetalLB layer 2 really does not implement a load balancer. Rather, it implements a failover mechanism so that a different node can take over should the current leader node fail for some reason.

MetalLB consists of two different pods:

- Controller: resposible for handling IP address assigments from a configured Pool.
- Speaker: DaemonSet pod running on each worker node, resposible for announcing the allocated IPs.

## Requesting Specific IPs

MetalLB respects the Kubernetes service `spec.loadBalancerIP` parameter, so if a static IP address from the available pool need to be set up for a specific service, it can be requested by setting that parameter. If MetalLB does not own the requested address, or if the address is already in use by another service, assignment will fail and MetalLB will log a warning event visible in `kubectl describe service <service name>`.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
Service's `.spec.loadBalancerIP` was the method used to specify the external IP, from load balancer Ip Pool, to be assigned to the service. It has been deprecated since [Kubernetes v1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) and might be removed in a future release. It is recommended to use implementation-specific annotations when available

In case of Metal LB the annotation that can be used is `metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs`

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  annotations:
    metallb.universe.tf/loadBalancerIPs: 192.168.1.44

```
See details in [Metal-LB usage doc](https://metallb.universe.tf/usage/)

## Install Metal Load Balancer


Installation using `Helm` (Release 3):

- Step 1: Add the Metal LB Helm repository:
  
    ```shell
    helm repo add metallb https://metallb.github.io/metallb
    ```

- Step 2: Fetch the latest charts from the repository:

    ```shell
    helm repo update
    ```

- Step 3: Create namespace

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace metallb
    ```

- Step 4: Install Metallb in the `metallb` namespace.

    ```shell
    helm install metallb metallb/metallb --namespace metallb
    ```
  
  
- Step 5: Confirm that the deployment succeeded, run:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n metallb get pod
    ```

- Step 6: Configure IP addess pool and the announcement method (L2 configuration)

  Create the following manifest file: `metallb-config.yaml`
    ```yml
    ---
    # Metallb address pool
    apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
    kind: IPAddressPool
    metadata:
      name: picluster-pool
      namespace: metallb
    spec:
      addresses:
      - 10.0.0.100-10.0.0.200

    ---
    # L2 configuration
    apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
    kind: L2Advertisement
    metadata:
      name: example
      namespace: metallb
    spec:
      ipAddressPools:
      - picluster-pool

    ```
   
   Apply the manifest file

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f metallb-config.yaml
   ```

    After a while, metallb is deployed and traefik LoadBalancer service gets its externa-ip from the configured pool and is accessible from outside the cluster

    ```shell
    kubectl get services --all-namespaces
    NAMESPACE     NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
    default       kubernetes       ClusterIP      10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                      63m
    kube-system   kube-dns         ClusterIP      10.43.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP       63m
    kube-system   metrics-server   ClusterIP      10.43.169.140   <none>        443/TCP                      63m
    kube-system   traefik          LoadBalancer   10.43.50.56     10.0.0.100    80:30582/TCP,443:30123/TCP   60m
    ```
{{site.data.alerts.important}}

  In previous chart releases there was a way to configure MetallB in deployment time providing the following values.yaml:
  
  ```yml
    configInline:
      address-pools:
        - name: default
            protocol: layer2
            addresses:
              - 10.0.0.100-10.0.0.200
  ```
  Helm chart `configInline` in `values.yaml` has been deprecated since MetalLB 0.13.
  Configuration must be done creating the corresponding MetalLB Kubernets CRD (`IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisement`). See [MetalLB configuration documentation](https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/).
