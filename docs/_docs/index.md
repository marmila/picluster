## Scope
The scope of this project is to create a kubernetes cluster at home using **Raspberry Pis** and to automate its deployment and configuration applying **IaC (infrastructure as a code)** and **GitOps** methodologies with tools like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

As part of the project, the goal is to use a lightweight Kubernetes flavor based on [K3S](https://k3s.io/) and deploy cluster basic services such as: 1) distributed block storage for POD's persistent volumes, [LongHorn](https://longhorn.io/), 2) backup/restore solution for the cluster, [Velero](https://velero.io/) and [Restic](https://restic.net/), 3) service mesh architecture, [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), and 4) observability platform based on metrics monitoring solution, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), logging and analytics solution, EFá¸°+LG stack ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)-[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)/[Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io/)-[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) + [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)-[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/)), and distributed tracing solution, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/).


The following picture shows the set of opensource solutions used for building this cluster:

## Design Principles

- Use ARM 64 bits operating system enabling the possibility of using Raspberry PI B nodes with 8GB RAM. Currently only Ubuntu supports 64 bits ARM distribution for Raspberry Pi.
- Use ligthweigh Kubernetes distribution (K3S). Kuberentes distribution with a smaller memory footprint which is ideal for running on Raspberry PIs
- Use of distributed storage block technology, instead of centralized NFS system, for pod persistent storage.  Kubernetes block distributed storage solutions, like Rook/Ceph or Longhorn, in their latest versions have included ARM 64 bits support.
- Use of opensource projects under the [CNCF: Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) umbrella
- Use latest versions of each opensource project to be able to test the latest Kubernetes capabilities.
- Use of [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to automate the initial OS installation.
- Use of [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) for automating the configuration of the cluster nodes, installation of kubernetes and external services, and triggering cluster bootstrap (ArgoCD bootstrap).
- Use of [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically provision Kubernetes applications from git repository.

## What I have built so far

From hardware perspective I built two different versions of the cluster

- Release 1.0: Basic version using dedicated USB flash drive for each node and centrazalized SAN as additional storage

![Cluster-1.0](/assets/img/pi-cluster.png)

- Release 2.0: Adding dedicated SSD disk to each node of the cluster and improving a lot the overall cluster performance

## What I have developed so far

From software perspective I have develop, cloud-init templates, Ansible code and packaged Kubernetes applications to be deployed with ArgoCD.

All source code can be found in the following github repository

   | Repo | Description | Github |
   | ---| --- | --- | 
   |  pi-cluster | PI Cluster Ansible  | [{{site.data.icons.github}}]({{site.git_address}})|
   {: .table }

1. **Cloud-init** template files for initial OS installation

   Source code can be found in Pi Cluster Git repository under [`/cloud-init`]({{site.git_address}}/tree/master/cloud-init) directory.


2. **Ansible** playbook and roles for configuring cluster nodes and installating and bootstraping K3S cluster  
   
   Source code can be found in Pi Cluster Git repository under [`/ansible`]({{site.git_address}}/tree/master/ansible) directory.

   Aditionally several ansible roles have been developed to automate different configuration tasks on Ubuntu-based servers that can be reused in other projects. These roles are used by Pi-Cluster Ansible Playbooks

   Each ansible role source code can be found in its dedicated Github repository and is published in Ansible-Galaxy to facilitate its installation with `ansible-galaxy` command.
