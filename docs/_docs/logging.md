## EFK vs PLG Stacks

Two different stacks can be deployed as centralized logging solution for the kubernetes cluster:

- **EFK stack ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)-[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)/[Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io/)-[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/))**, where:
  - *Elasticsearch* is used as logs storage and search engine
  - *Fluentd/Fluentbit* used for collecting, aggregate and distribute logs
  - *Kibana* is used as visualization layer.

  This is a mature open-source stack for implementing centralized log management and log analytics capabilities.
  Since Elasticsearch indexes the whole content of the logs the resources required by the solution in terms of storage and memory are high.

- **PLG stack ([Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) - [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/))**, where:
  - *Promtail* is used as log collector
  - *Loki* as log storage/aggregator
  - *Grafana* as visualization layer.

  Loki is a lightweigh alternative to Elasticsearch providing a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus for Kubernetes environments.

  Loki consumption of resources is lower than ES because it does not index the contents of the logs, it rather indexes a set of labels for each log stream. 

In the cluster both stacks can be deployed to deliver complimentary logs-based monitoring (observability) and advance log analytics capabilities.

The logging architecture will have the following components:

1. Loki as key component of the Observability platform. Loki, managing logs like prometheus metrics, with the same labels, makes possible to join in the same Grafana dashboards metrics (prometheus), logs (Loki) and traces (jaegger) belonging to the same context (pod, application, container). This way Grafana can be used as single plane of glass for monitoring cluster services.

2. ElasticSearh/Kibana providing advance log analytics capabilities. Loki indexing capabilities are limited to logs labels while ES indexes whole content of the logs. Kibana provides many visualization tools to do analysis on ES indexed data, such as location maps, machine learning for anomaly detection, and graphs to discover relationships in data.

3. Common architecture for log collection, aggregation and distribution based on Fluentbit/Fluentd. Fluentbit/Fluentd can be used to distribute logs to both logs storage platform (ES and Loki) instead of deploying two separate log collectors (Fluentbit and Promtail).

   Fluentbit/Fluentd selected over Promtail, because it is a general purpose log colletor/distributor, that can be used to ingest logs from different sources (not only kubernetes), parsing and filtering them, and route them to different destinations. Promtail is tailored only to work only with Loki.

In the cluster you can decide to install EFK (Elatic-Fluent-Kibana) stack or FLG (Fluent-Loki-Grafana) stack or both, sharing the same log collection and distribution layer (Fluentbit/Fluentd)

The architecture is shown in the following picture

![K3S-EFK-LOKI-Architecture](/assets/img/efk-loki-logging-architecture.png)

This solution will not only process logs from kubernetes cluster but also collects the logs from external nodes (i.e.: `gateway` node.)

{{site.data.alerts.important}} **ARM/Kubernetes support**

In June 2020, Elastic [announced](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-on-arm) that starting from 7.8 release they will provide multi-architecture docker images supporting AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

Fluentd and Fluentbit both support ARM64 docker images for being deployed on Kubernetes clusters with the built-in configuration needed to automatically collect and parsing containers logs.

Loki also supports ARM64 docker images.

## Collecting cluster logs

### Container logs

In Kubernetes, containerized applications that log to `stdout` and `stderr` have their log streams captured and redirected to log files on the nodes (`/var/log/containers`). To tail these log files, filter log events, transform the log data, and ship it off to the Elasticsearch logging backend, a process like, fluentd/fluentbit can be used.

To learn more about kubernetes logging architecture check out [“Cluster-level logging architectures”](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging) from the official Kubernetes docs. Logging architecture using [node-level log agents](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#using-a-node-logging-agent) is the one implemented with fluentbit/fluentd log collectors. Fluentbit/fluentd proccess run in each node as a kubernetes' daemonset with enough privileges to access to host file system where container logs are stored (`/var/logs/containers` in K3S implementation).

[Fluentbit and fluentd official helm charts](https://github.com/fluent/helm-charts) deploy the fluentbit/fluentd pods as privileged daemonset with access to hots' `/var/logs` directory.
In addition to container logs, same Fluentd/Fluentbit agents deployed as daemonset can collect and parse logs from systemd-based services and OS filesystem level logs (syslog, kern.log, etc., all of them located in `/var/logs`)

{{site.data.alerts.important}} **About Kubernetes log format**

Log format used by Kubernetes is different depending on the container runtime used. `docker` container run-time generates logs in JSON format. `containerd` run-time, used by K3S, uses CRI log format:

CRI log format is the following:
```
<time_stamp> <stream_type> <P/F> <log>

where:
  - <time_stamp> has the format `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L%z` Date and time including UTC offset
  - <stream_type> is `stdout` or `stderr`
  - <P/F> indicates whether the log line is partial (P), in case of multine logs, or full log line (F)
  - <log>: message log
```

Fluentbit/Fluentd includes built-in CRI log parser.

### Kubernetes logs

In K3S all kuberentes componentes (API server, scheduler, controller, kubelet, kube-proxy, etc.) are running within a single process (k3s). This process when running with `systemd` writes all its logs to  `/var/log/syslog` file. This file need to be parsed in order to collect logs from Kubernetes (K3S) processes.

K3S logs can be also viewed with `journactl` command

In master node:

```shell
sudo journactl -u k3s
```

In worker node:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u k3s-agent
```

### Host logs

OS level logs (`/var/logs`) can be collected with the same agent deployed to collect containers logs (daemonset)  

{{site.data.alerts.important}} **About Ubuntu's syslog-format logs**

Some of Ubuntu system logs stored are `/var/logs` (auth.log, systlog, kern.log) have a `syslog` format but with some differences from the standard:
 - Priority field is missing
 - Timestamp is formatted using system local time.

The syslog format is the following:
```
<time_stamp> <host> <process>[<PID>] <message>
Where:
  - <time_stamp> has the format `%b %d %H:%M:%S`: local date and time not including timezone UTC offset
  - <host>: hostanme
  - <process> and <PID> identifies the process generating the log
```
Fluentbit/fluentd custom parser need to be configured to parse this kind of logs.

## Log collection, aggregation and distribution architectures

Two different architectures can be implemented with Fluentbit and Fluentd

  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/logging-forwarder-only.png" alt="logging-forwarder-only" width="400" /></td>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/logging-forwarder-aggregator.png" alt="logging-forwarder-aggregator" width="400" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Forwarder-only architecture

This pattern includes having a logging agent, based on fluentbit or fluentd, deployed on edge (forwarder), generally where data is created, such as Kubernetes nodes, virtual machines or baremetal servers. These forwarder agents collect, parse and filter logs from the edge nodes and send data direclty to a backend service.

**Advantages**

- No aggregator is needed; each agent handles [backpressure](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/backpressure).

**Disadvantages**

- Hard to change configuration across a fleet of agents (E.g., adding another backend or processing)
- Hard to add more end destinations if needed

### Forwarder/Aggregator Architecture

Similar to the forwarder-only deployment, lightweight logging agent instance is deployed on edge (forwarder) close to data sources (kubernetes nodes, virtual machines or baremetal servers). In this case, these forwarders do minimal processing and then use the forward protocol to send data to a much heavier instance of Fluentd or Fluent Bit (aggregator). This heavier instance may perform more filtering and processing before routing to the appropriate backend(s).

**Advantages**

- Less resource utilization on the edge devices (maximize throughput)

- Allow processing to scale independently on the aggregator tier.

- Easy to add more backends (configuration change in aggregator vs. all forwarders).

**Disadvantages**

- Dedicated resources required for an aggregation instance.

With this architecture, in the aggregation layer, logs can be filtered and routed to different logs backends: Elastisearch and Loki. In the future different backend can be added to do further online processing. For example Kafka can be deployed as backend to build a Data Streaming Analytics architecture (Kafka, Apache Spark, Flink, etc) and route only the logs from a specfic application. 

{{site.data.alerts.note}}

Forwarder/Aggregator architecture will be deployed in the cluster.
