[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is used as Secret Management solution for Raspberry PI cluster. All cluster secrets (users, passwords, api tokens, etc) will be securely encrypted and stored in Vault.

Vault will be deployed as a external service, not running as a Kuberentes service, so it can be used by GitOps solution, ArgoCD/FluxCD, to deploy automatically all cluster services.

Vault could be installed as Kuberentes service, deploying it using an official Helm Chart or a community operator like [Banzai Bank-Vault](https://banzaicloud.com/products/bank-vaults/).

Installing Vault as Kubernetes service will drive us to a chicken/egg situation if we want to use Vault as only source of secrets/credentials for all Kuberentes services deployed. Vault requires to have Block storage solution (Longhorn) deployed first since its POD needs Perstistent Volumes, and to install Longhorn, a few secrets need to be provided to configure its backup (Minio credentials).

[External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/) will be used to automatically generate the Kubernetes Secrets from Vault data that is needed to deploy the different services using FluxCD/ArgoCD.

## Vault installation

Vault installation and configuration tasks have been automated with Ansible developing a role: **ricsanfre.vault**. This role, installs Vault Server, initialize it and install a systemd service to automatically unseal it whenever vault server is restarted.

### Vault installation from binaries

Instead of installing Vault using official Ubuntu packages, installation will be done manually from binaries, so the version to be installed can be decided.

-   Step 1. Create vault's UNIX user/group

  vault user is a system user, not login allowed
  ```shell
  sudo groupadd vault
  sudo useradd vault -g vault -r -s /sbin/nologin
  ```
- Step 2. Create vault's storage directory

    ```shell
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/vault
    chown -R vault:vault /var/lib/vault
    chmod -R 750 /var/lib/vault
    ```

-   Step 3. Create vault's config directories

    ```shell
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/vault
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/vault/tls
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/vault/policy
    sudo mkidr -p /etc/vault/plugin
    chown -R vault:vault /etc/vault
    chmod -R 750 /etc/vault
    ```

-   Step 4: Create vault's log directory

    ```shell
    sudo mkdir /var/log/vault
    chown -R vault:vault /var/log/vault
    chmod -R 750 /var/log/vault
    ```
-   Step 5. Download server binary (`vault`) and copy them to `/usr/local/bin`

    ```shell
    wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/<version>/vault_<version>_linux_<arch>.zip
    unzip vault_<version>_linux_<arch>.zip
    chmod +x vault
    sudo mv vault /usr/local/bin/.
    ```
    where `<arch>` is amd64 or arm64, and `<version>` is vault version (for example: 1.12.2).


-   Step 6. Create Vault TLS certificate

    In case you have your own domain, a trusted TLS certificate signed by [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) can be obtained for Vault server, using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

    See certbot installation instructions in [TLS Certiciates (CertBot)](/docs/certbot/). Those instructions indicate how to install certbot using DNS challenge with IONOS DNS provider (my DNS provider). Similar procedures can be followed for other DNS providers.

    Letsencrypt using HTTP challenge is avoided for security reasons (cluster services are not exposed to public internet).

    If generating trusted TLS certificate is not possible, selfsigned certificates with a custom CA can be used instead.

    Follow this procedure for creating a self-signed certificate for Vault Server

    1.  Create a self-signed CA key and self-signed certificate

        ```shell
        openssl req -x509 \
                -sha256 \
                -nodes \
                -newkey rsa:4096 \
                -subj "/CN=My CA" \
                -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt
        ```

        {{site.data.alerts.note}}

        The one created during Minio installation can be re-used.

        {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    2.  Create a TLS certificate for Vault server signed using the custom CA

        -   Create key

            ```shell
            openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
            ```
        -   Create a file named `openssl.conf` with the content below. Set `IP.1` and/or `DNS.1` to point to the correct IP/DNS addresses:

            ```sh
            [req]
            distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
            x509_extensions = v3_req
            prompt = no

            [req_distinguished_name]
            C = ES
            ST = Madrid
            L = Somewhere
            O = MyOrg
            OU = MyOU
            CN = MyServerName

            [v3_req]
            subjectAltName = @alt_names

            [alt_names]
            IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
            DNS.1 = vault.mydomain.com
            ```

            Run `openssl` by specifying the configuration file and enter a passphrase if prompted:

            ```shell
            openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 730 -key private.key -out vault.csr -config openssl.conf
            ```
        -   Verify the csr's content

            ```shell
            openssl req -in public.csr -noout -text
            ```
        -   Generate the certificate using the vault csr and key along with the CA Root key

            ```shell
            openssl x509 -req -in vault.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out public.crt -days 500 -sha256
            ```

    Once the certificate is created, public certificate and private key need to be installed in Vault server following this procedure:


    1.  Copy public certificate `vault.crt` as `/etc/vault/tls/vault.crt`

        ```shell
        sudo cp vault.crt /etc/vault/tls/public.crt
        sudo chown vault:vault /etc/vault/tls/public.crt
        ```
    2.  Copy private key `vault.key` as `/etc/vault/tls/vault.key`

        ```shell
        cp vault.key /etc/vault/tls/vault.key
        sudo chown vault:vault /etc/vault/tls/vault.key
        ```
    3.  Copy CA certificate `rootCA.crt` as `/etc/vault/tls/vault-ca.crt`

        {{site.data.alerts.note}}

        This step is only needed if using selfsigned certificate.

        {{site.data.alerts.end}}

        ```shell
        cp rootCA.crt /etc/vault/tls/vault-ca.crt
        sudo chown vault:vault /etc/vault/tls/vault-ca.crt
      ```

-   Step 7: Create vault config file `/etc/vault/vault_main.hcl`

    ```
    cluster_addr  = "https://<node_ip>:8201"
    api_addr      = "https://<node_ip>:8200"

    plugin_directory = "/etc/vault/plugin"

    disable_mlock = true

    listener "tcp" {
      address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
      tls_cert_file      = "/etc/vault/tl/vault.crt"
      tls_key_file       = "/etc/vault/tls/vault.key"

      tls_disable_client_certs = true

    }

    storage "raft" {
      path    = /var/lib/vault

    }
    ```

    Vault is configured, as a single node of HA cluster, with the following parameters:

    - Node's URL address to be used in internal communications between nodes of the cluster. (`cluster_addr` and `api_addr`)
    - Vault server API listening in all node's addresses at port 8200: (`listener "tcp" address=0.0.0.0:8200`)
    - TLS certifificates are stored in `/etc/vault/tls`
    - Client TLS certificates validation is disabled (`tls_disable_client_certs`)
    - Vault is configured to use integrated storage [Raft](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft) data dir `/var/lib/vault`
    - Disables the server from executing the mlock syscall (`disable_mlock`) recommended when using Raft storage


-   Step 8. Create systemd vault service file `/etc/systemd/system/vault.service`

    ```

    ```

    {{site.data.alerts.note}}

    This systemd configuration is the one that official vault ubuntu's package installs.

    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

  2. Create a TLS certificate for Vault server signed using the custom CA

     ```shell
     openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 \
                 -keyout vault.key \
                 -out vault.csr \
                 -batch \
                 -subj "/C=ES/ST=Madrid/L=Madrid/O=Ricsanfre CA/OU=picluster/CN=vault.picluster.ricsanfre.com"

    ```shell
    /usr/local/vault server -config=/etc/vault/vault_main.hcl -log-level=info
    ```

-   Step 9. Enable vault systemd service and start it

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl enable vault.service
    sudo systemctl start vault.service
    ```

-   Step 10. Check vault server status

    ```shell
    export VAULT_ADDR=https://<vault_ip>:8200
    export VAULT_CACERT=/etc/vault/tls/vault-ca.crt

    vault status
    ```

    The output should be like the following

    ```shell
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    Seal Type          shamir
    Initialized        false
    Sealed             true
    Total Shares       0
    Threshold          0
    Unseal Progress    0/0
    Unseal Nonce       n/a
    Version            1.12.2
    Build Date         2022-11-23T12:53:46Z
    Storage Type       raft
    HA Enabled         true
    ```

    It shows Vault server status as not initialized (Initialized = false) and sealed (Sealed = true).

    {{site.data.alerts.note}}

    VAULT_CACERT variable is only needed if Vault's TLS certificate is signed using custom CA. This will be used by vault client to validate Vault's certificate.

    {{site.data.alerts.end}}


### Vault initialization and useal

During initialization, Vault generates a root key, which is stored in the storage backend alongside all other Vault data. The root key itself is encrypted and requires an unseal key to decrypt it.

Unseal process, where uneal keys are provided to rebuid the root key, need to be completed every time vault server is started.

The default Vault configuration uses [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) to split the root key into a configured number of shards (referred as key shares, or unseal keys). A certain threshold of shards is required to reconstruct the root key, which is then used to decrypt the Vault's encryption key.

To initialize vault [`vault operator init`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/operator/init) command must be used.

```shell
vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1 -format=json > /etc/vault/unseal.json
```
where number of key shares (`-key-shares`) and threshold (`-key-threshold`) is set to 1. Only one key is needed to unseal vault.

The vault init command output is redirected to a file (`/etc/vault/unseal.json`) containing unseal keys values and root token needed to connect to vault.

```json
{
  "unseal_keys_b64": [
    "UEDYFGa/oVUehw5eflXt2mdoE8zJD3QVub8b++rNCm8="
  ],
  "unseal_keys_hex": [
    "5040d81466bfa1551e870e5e7e55edda676813ccc90f7415b9bf1bfbeacd0a6f"
  ],
  "unseal_shares": 1,
  "unseal_threshold": 1,
  "recovery_keys_b64": [],
  "recovery_keys_hex": [],
  "recovery_keys_shares": 0,
  "recovery_keys_threshold": 0,
  "root_token": "hvs.AJxt0CgXT9BcVe5dMNeI0Unm"
}
```

`vault status` shows Vault server initialized but sealed

```shell
vault status
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true
Sealed             true
Total Shares       1
Threshold          1
Unseal Progress    0/1
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            1.12.2
Build Date         2022-11-23T12:53:46Z
Storage Type       raft
HA Enabled         true
```

To unseal vault `vault operator unseal` command need to be executed, providing unseal keys generated during initialization process.


Using the key stored in `unseal.json` file the following command can be executed:

```shell
vault operator unseal $(jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[0]' /etc/vault/unseal.json)
```

`vault status` shows Vault server initialized and unsealed

```shell
vault status
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true
Sealed             true
Total Shares       1
Threshold          1
Unseal Progress    0/1
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            1.12.2
Build Date         2022-11-23T12:53:46Z
Storage Type       raft
HA Enabled         true
```

### Vault automatic unseal

A systemd service can be created to automatically unseal vault every time it is started.


- Step 1: Create a script (`/etc/vault/vault-unseal.sh`) for automating the unseal process using the keys stored in `/etc/vault/unseal.json`

  ```shell
  #!/usr/bin/env sh

  #Define a timestamp function
  timestamp() {
  date "+%b %d %Y %T %Z"
  }


  URL=https://<vault_dns>:8200
  KEYS_FILE=/etc/vault/unseal.json

  LOG=info

  SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true

  if [ true = "$SKIP_TLS_VERIFY" ]
  then
    CURL_PARAMS="-sk"
  else
    CURL_PARAMS="-s"
  fi

  # Add timestamp
  echo "$(timestamp): Vault-useal started" | tee -a $LOG
  echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" | tee -a $LOG

  initialized=$(curl $CURL_PARAMS $URL/v1/sys/health | jq '.initialized')

  if [ true = "$initialized" ]
  then
    echo "$(timestamp): Vault already initialized" | tee -a $LOG
    while true
    do
      status=$(curl $CURL_PARAMS $URL/v1/sys/health | jq '.sealed')
      if [ true = "$status" ]
      then
          echo "$(timestamp): Vault Sealed. Trying to unseal" | tee -a $LOG
          # Get keys from json file
          for i in `jq -r '.keys[]' $KEYS_FILE`
            do curl $CURL_PARAMS --request PUT --data "{\"key\": \"$i\"}" $URL/v1/sys/unseal
          done
      sleep 10
      else
          echo "$(timestamp): Vault unsealed" | tee -a $LOG
          break
      fi
    done
  else
    echo "$(timestamp): Vault not initialized yet"
  fi
  ```

- Step 2: Create systemd vault service file `/etc/systemd/system/vault-unseal.service`

  ```
  [Unit]
  Description=Vault Unseal
  After=vault.service
  Requires=vault.service
  PartOf=vault.service

  [Service]
  Type=oneshot
  User=vault
  Group=vault
  ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
  ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/etc/vault/vault-unseal.sh'
  RemainAfterExit=false

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target vault.service
  ```

  This service is defined as part of vault.service (`PartOf`), so stopping/starting vault.service is propagated to this service.

- Step 3. Enable vault systemd service and start it

  ```shell
  sudo systemctl enable vault-unseal.service
  sudo systemctl start vault-unseal.service
  ```


## Vault configuration


Once vault is unsealed following configuration requires to provide vault's root token generated during initialization procces. See `root_token` in `unseal.json` output.

```shell
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.root_token' /etc/vault/unseal.json)
```

{{site.data.alerts.note}}

As an alternative to `vault` commands, API can be used. See [Vault API documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs)

`curl` command can be used. Vault token need to be provider as a HTTP header `X-Vault-Token`

Get request
```shell
curl -k -H "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" $VAULT_ADDR/<api_endpoint>
```

Post request

```shell
curl -k -x POST -H "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" -d '{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}' $VAULT_ADDR/<api_endpoint>
```

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Enabling KV secrets

Enable [KV (KeyValue) secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv) to manage static secrets.

```shell
vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=secret kv
```

This command enables KV version 2 at path `/secret`

### Vault policies

Create vault policies to read and read/write KV secrets

- Read-write policy

  Create file `/etc/vault/policy/secrets-write.hcl`

  ```
  path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "patch" ]
  }
  ```
  Add policy to vault

  ```shell
  vault policy write readwrite /etc/vault/policy/secrets-readwrite.hcl
  ```

- Read-only policy

  Create file `/etc/vault/policy/secrets-read.hcl`
  ```
  path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = [ "read" ]
  }
  ```

  Add policy to vault

  ```shell
  vault policy write readonly /etc/vault/policy/secrets-read.hcl
  ```

Testing policies:

- Generate tokens for read and write policies

  ```shell
  READ_TOKEN=$(vault token create -policy="readonly" -field=token)
  WRITE_TOKEN=$(vault token create -policy="readwrite" -field=token)
  ```

- Try write a secret using read token

  ```shell
  VAULT_TOKEN=$READ_TOKEN
  vault kv put secret/secret1 user="user1" password="s1cret0"
  ```

  Permission denied error:

  ```
  Code: 403. Errors:

  * 1 error occurred:
    * permission denied
  ```

- Try write a secret using write token

  ```shell
  VAULT_TOKEN=$WRITE_TOKEN
  vault kv put secret/secret1 user="user1" password="s1cret0"
  ```
  The secret is stored with success:
  ```
  === Secret Path ===
  secret/data/secret1

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       2023-01-02T11:04:21.01853116Z
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

- Secret can be read using both tokens

  ```shell
  vault kv get secret/secret1
  ```

  ```
  === Secret Path ===
  secret/data/secret1

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       2023-01-02T11:04:21.01853116Z
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1

  ====== Data ======
  Key         Value
  ---         -----
  password    s1cret0
  user        user1
  ```


###  External Vault - Kubernetes Integration

Using Vault Agent Injector and Vault CSI Provider are two different ways to make secrets available to Pods running in a Kubernetes Cluster. See details in https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/deploy/kubernetes/injector-csi. This two components can be installed using Vault Helm chart. Using Vault helm chart, a Vault server running as a Kubernetes service can be deployed or only Vault Agent Injector and CSI Provider can be deployed using a external Vault Server.

As an alternative External Secrets Operator can be used to automatically synchronize Vault secrets and Kubernetes Secrets.

In both cases, [Vault kubernetes auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) need to be configured so Kubernetes Service Accounts can be used to authenticate against Vault.

For details about configuring External Vault see the guide [Integrate Kubernetes with an external Vault cluster](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes-introduction/kubernetes-external-vault)

#### Configure Kubernetes Auth Method (Not using Vault Helm Chart)

Enabling [Vault kubernetes auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) to authenticate with Vault using a Kubernetes Service Account Token. This method of authentication makes it easy to introduce a Vault token into a Kubernetes Pod.

- Step 1. Create `vault` namespace

  ```shell
  kubectl create namespace vault
  ```

- Step 2. Create service account `vault-auth` to be used by Vault kuberentes authentication

  ```yml
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: vault-auth
    namespace: vault
  ```

- Step 3. Add proper permissions to service account

  Vault kubernetes authentication method accesses the Kubernetes TokenReview API to validate the provided JWT is still valid. Service Accounts used in this auth method will need to have access to the TokenReview API. If Kubernetes is configured to use RBAC roles, the Service Account should be granted permissions to access this API.
  Check more details in [Vault - Kubernetes Auth Method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes#configuring-kubernetes)

  ```yml
  ---
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  metadata:
    name: role-tokenreview-binding
    namespace: vault
  roleRef:
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: system:auth-delegator
  subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: vault-auth
      namespace: vault
  ```

- Step 4. Create long-lived token for vault-auth service account.
  From Kubernetes v1.24, secrets contained long-lived tokens associated to service accounts are not longer created.
  See how to create it in [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#manually-create-a-long-lived-api-token-for-a-serviceaccount)

  ```yml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
  metadata:
    name: vault-auth-secret
    namespace: vault
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/service-account.name: vault-auth
  ```

- Step 5. Get Service Account token

  ```shell
  KUBERNETES_SA_SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl get secrets --output=json -n vault | jq -r '.items[].metadata | select(.name|startswith("vault-auth")).name')
  TOKEN_REVIEW_JWT=$(kubectl get secret $KUBERNETES_SA_SECRET_NAME -n vault -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)
  ```

- Step 6. Get Kubernetes CA cert and API URL

  ```shell
  # Get Kubernetes CA
  kubectl config view --raw --minify --flatten --output='jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.certificate-authority-data}' | base64 --decode > k3s_ca.crt

  # Get Kubernetes Url
  KUBERNETES_HOST=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[].cluster.server}')
  ```

- Step 7. Enable Kubernetes auth method

  ```shell
  vault auth enable kubernetes
  ```

  Or using Vault API

  ```shell
  curl -k --header "X-Vault-Token:$VAULT_TOKEN" --request POST\
    --data '{"type":"kubernetes","description":"kubernetes auth"}' \
    https://${VAULT_SERVER}:8200/v1/sys/auth/kubernetes
  ```

- Step 8. Configure Vault kubernetes auth method

  ```shell
  vault write auth/kubernetes/config  \
    token_reviewer_jwt="${TOKEN_REVIEW_JWT}" \
    kubernetes_host="${KUBERNETES_HOST}" \
    kubernetes_ca_cert=@k3s_ca.crt
    disable_iss_validation=true
  ```

  Or using Vault API:

  ```shell
  KUBERNETES_CA_CERT=$(kubectl config view --raw --minify --flatten --output='jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.certificate-authority-data}' | base64 --decode | awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}')

  curl --cacert /etc/vault/tls/vault_ca.pem --header "X-Vault-Token:$VAULT_TOKEN" --request POST --data '{"kubernetes_host": "'"$KUBERNETES_HOST"'", "kubernetes_ca_cert":"'"$KUBERNETES_CA_CERT"'", "token_reviewer_jwt":"'"$TOKEN_REVIEW_JWT"'"}' https://${VAULT_SERVER}:8200/v1/auth/kubernetes/config
  ```

#### Configure Kubernetes Auth Method (Using Vault Helm Chart)

The Vault Helm chart is able to install only the Vault Agent Injector service.

-   Step 1: Add the HashiCorp Helm repository.

    ```shell
    $ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
    "hashicorp" has been added to your repositories
    ```

-   Step 2: Update all the repositories to ensure `helm` is aware of the latest versions.

    ```shell
    $ helm repo update
    Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
    ...Successfully got an update from the "hashicorp" chart repository
    Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
    ```

-   Step 3: Create vault namespace
    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace vault
    ```

-   Step 4: Create helm chart values file: `vault-values.yaml`
    ```yaml
    global:
      # External vault server address for the injector and CSI provider to use.
      # Setting this will disable deployment of a vault server.
      externalVaultAddr: "${VAULT_ADDR}"
    # Create Service Account an long-lived token for enabling Kubernetes Auth Method
    server:
      # authDelegator enables a cluster role binding to be attached to the service
      # account.  This cluster role binding can be used to setup Kubernetes auth
      # method. See https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes
      authDelegator:
        enabled: true
      serviceAccount:
        # Specifies whether a service account should be created
        create: true
        # The name of the service account to use.
        # If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template
        name: vault-auth
        # Create a Secret API object to store a non-expiring token for the service account.
        # Prior to v1.24.0, Kubernetes used to generate this secret for each service account by default.
        # Kubernetes now recommends using short-lived tokens from the TokenRequest API or projected volumes instead if possible.
        # For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#service-account-token-secrets
        # serviceAccount.create must be equal to 'true' in order to use this feature.
        createSecret: true
    ```
    {{site.data.alerts.note}}
    Substitute variables in the above yaml (`${var}`) file before deploying helm chart.
    -   Replace `${VAULT_ADDR}` by the URL of the external Vault (i.e: https://vault.mydomain.com:8200)
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    With this configuration service account (`vault-auth`) and its long-lived token is created. Also ClusterRoleBinding is created. Resources created in Steps 2 to 4 in the previous procedure ([[#Configure Kubernetes Auth Method (Not using Vault Helm Chart)]]) are automatically created by Helm Chart.

-   Step 5: Install the latest version of the Vault server running in external mode.

    ```shell
    $ helm upgrade --install --namespace=vault vault hashicorp/vault -f vault-values.yam
    ```

-   Step 6: Check Vault Agent injector has started
    The Vault Agent Injector pod is deployed in `vault` namespace.

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n vault
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    vault-agent-injector-64b5d5dc99-ppz9k   1/1     Running   0          13m
    ```

-   Step 7: Configure Kubernetes Auth method in external Vault, following steps 5 to 8 of [[#Configure Kubernetes Auth Method (Not using Vault Helm Chart)]]

### Observability

#### Metrics

Vault provides rich operational [telemetry metrics](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/internals/telemetry) that you can consume with popular solutions for monitoring and alerting on key operational conditions.

##### Prometheus Integration

Vault can be configured to expose Metrics in Prometheus-compliant format:

Following lines need to be added to Vault config file

```hcl
telemetry {
  disable_hostname = true
  prometheus_retention_time = "12h"
}
```

Querying `/v1/sys/metrics` with one of the following headers:

- [`Accept: prometheus/telemetry`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#accept-prometheus-telemetry)
- [`Accept: application/openmetrics-text`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#accept-application-openmetrics-text)

will return Prometheus formatted results.

A Vault token is required with `capabilities = ["read", "list"]` to /v1/sys/metrics. The Prometheus `bearer_token` or `bearer_token_file` options must be added to the scrape job.

Vault does not use the default Prometheus path, so Prometheus must be configured to scrape `v1/sys/metrics` instead of the default scrape path.

Following `curl` command can be used for testing Prometheus endpoint.

```shell
curl -k -H "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" -H "Accept: prometheus/telemetry" https://vault.homelab.ricsanfre.com:8200/v1/sys/metrics
```

Before using it, valid token need to be extracted

```shell
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.root_token' /etc/vault/unseal.json)
```

-   Step 1: Deploy Vault Agent Injestor using Vault Helm chart and configure Kubernetes Vault auth. See above section [Configure Kubernetes Auth Method using Vault Helm Chart](#configure-kubernetes-auth-method-using-vault-helm-chart)

    This will deploy Vault Agent Injector in `vault` namespace, which will inject Vault Agent into Prometheus pod.

-   Step 2: Creating Vault policy for Prometheus, granting access to metrics endpoint

    ```shell
    vault policy write prometheus-monitoring - << EOF
        path "/sys/metrics" {
          capabilities = ["read", "list"]
        }
    EOF
    ```

-   Step 3: Attach the policy to the existing `kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus` ServiceAccount used by the Prometheus pod

    ```shell
    vault write auth/kubernetes/role/prometheus \
          bound_service_account_names=kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus \
          bound_service_account_namespaces=kube-prom-stack \
          policies="default,prometheus-monitoring" \
          ttl="15m"
    ```

-   Step 4: Annotate Prometheus Pod, add following values to Kube-prom-stack, so Prometheus POD is automatically injected with Vault Agent

    ```yaml
    prometheus:
      prometheusSpec:
        podMetadata:
          annotations:
            vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
            vault.hashicorp.com/agent-init-first: "true"
            vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-token: "true"
            vault.hashicorp.com/role: "prometheus"
            # Using self-signed certificates, so we need to skip TLS verification
            vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify: "true"
            # Run agent as group 2000, same group used by Prometheus process. Grant read access to token file.
            vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-group: "2000"
     ```

    Prometheus POD have access to Vault Token at path `/vault/secrets/token` file.

-   Step 5: Configure Prometheus monitoring to Scrape Vault using token. Add following to Kube-prom-stack helm chart values file:

    ```
    prometheus:
      prometheusSpec:
        additionalScrapeConfigs:
        - job_name: vault
          metrics_path: /v1/sys/metrics
          params:
            format: ['prometheus']
          scheme: https
          authorization:
            credentials_file: /vault/secrets/token
          static_configs:
          - targets: [vault.domain.com:8200]
    ```

    Prometheus Operator's ScrapeConfig CRD does not support to provide the credentials using a file (`credentials_file` option is not supported), so vault scrape configuration is hardcoded into Prometheus CRD as `additionalScrapeConfigs`

##### Grafana Dashboards

Vault dashboard sample can be downloaded from [Grafana jsonnet libraries repo: vault-mixin](https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/blob/master/vault-mixin/dashboards/vault.json).

Dashboard can be automatically added using Grafana's dashboard providers configuration. See further details in ["PiCluster - Observability Visualization (Grafana): Automating installation of community dasbhoards](/docs/grafana/#automating-installation-of-grafana-community-dashboards)

Add following configuration to Grafana's helm chart values file:

```yaml
# Configure default Dashboard Provider
# https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#dashboards
dashboardProviders:
  dashboardproviders.yaml:
    apiVersion: 1
    providers:
      - name: infrastructure
        orgId: 1
        folder: "Infrastructure"
        type: file
        disableDeletion: false
        editable: true
        options:
          path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/infrastructure-folder

# Add dashboard
# Dashboards
dashboards:
  infrastructure:
    vault:
      url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/refs/heads/master/vault-mixin/dashboards/vault.json
      datasource: Prometheus
```

## External Secrets Operator installation

External Secrets Operator is installed through its helm chart.

-   Step 1: Add External sercrets repository:
    ```shell
    helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
    ```
-   Step 2: Fetch the latest charts from the repository:
    ```shell
    helm repo update
    ```
-   Step 3: Create namespace
    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace external-secrets
    ```
-   Step 4: Install helm chart
    ```shell
    helm install external-secrets \
      external-secrets/external-secrets \
        -n external-secrets \
        --set installCRDs=true
    ```
-   Step 5: Create external secrets vault role. Applying read policy

    ```shell
    vault write auth/kubernetes/role/external-secrets \
      bound_service_account_names=external-secrets \
      bound_service_account_namespaces=external-secrets \
      policies=readonly \
      ttl=24h
    ```

    Or using the Vault API

    ```shell
    curl -k --header "X-Vault-Token:$VAULT_TOKEN" --request POST \
      --data '{ "bound_service_account_names": "external-secrets", "bound_service_account_namespaces": "external-secrets", "policies": ["readonly"], "ttl" : "24h"}' \
      https://${VAULT_SERVER}:8200/v1/auth/kubernetes/role/external-secrets
    ```


-   Step 6: Create Cluster Secret Store

  ```yml
  apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
   kind: ClusterSecretStore
   metadata:
     name: vault-backend
     namespace: external-secrets
   spec:
     provider:
       vault:
         server: "https://vault.picluster.ricsanfre.com:8200"
         # caBundle needed if vault TLS is signed using a custom CA.
         # If Vault TLS is valid signed by Letsencrypt this is not needed?
         # ca cert base64 encoded and remobed '\n' characteres"
         # <vault-ca> =`cat vault-ca.pem | base64 | tr -d "\n"`
         caBundle: <vault-ca>
         path: "secret"
         version: "v2"
         auth:
           kubernetes:
             mountPath: "kubernetes"
             role: "external-secrets"
  ```

  Check ClusterSecretStore status

      Substitute variables (`${var}`) in the above yaml file before deploying mangifest file.
      -   Replace `${VAULT_SERVER}` by FQDN of the vault server (i.e. `vault.homelab.com`)

    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    Check ClusterSecretStore status

    ```shell
    kubectl get clustersecretstore -n external-secrets
    NAME            AGE   STATUS   CAPABILITIES   READY
    vault-backend   10m   Valid    ReadWrite      True
    ```

-   Step 7: Create External secret

    ```yml
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
    kind: ExternalSecret
    metadata:
      name: vault-example
    spec:
      secretStoreRef:
        name: vault-backend
        kind: ClusterSecretStore
      target:
        name: mysecret
      data:
      - secretKey: password
        remoteRef:
          key: secret1
          property: password
      - secretKey: user
        remoteRef:
          key: secret1
          property: user
    ```

    Check ExternalSecret status

    ```shell
    kubectl get externalsecret
    NAME            STORE           REFRESH INTERVAL   STATUS         READY
    vault-example   vault-backend   1h                 SecretSynced   True
    ```

    Check Secret created

    ```shell
    kubectl get secret mysecret -o yaml
    ```
