The home lab I am building is shown in the following picture

![Cluster-lab](/assets/img/pi-cluster-architecture.png)


A K3S cluster is composed of the following **cluster nodes**:
- 3 master nodes (`node2`, `node3` and `node4`), running on Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB)
- 5 worker nodes:
  - `node5` and `node6`running on Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB)
  - `node-hp-1`, `node-hp-2` and `node-hp-3` running on HP Elitedesk 800 G3 (16GB)

A **LAN switch** (16 Gigabit ports) used to provide L2 connectivity to the cluster nodes. L3 connectivity and internet access is provided by a router/firewall (`gateway`) running [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) on Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB) or GL-iNet Slate Plus (GL-A1300).

`gateway`, **cluster firewall/router** is connected to LAN Switch using its Gigabit Ethernet port. It is also connected to my home network using its WIFI interface, so it can route and filter traffic comming in/out the cluster. With this architecture my lab network can be isolated from my home network.

`gateway` also provides networking services to my lab network:
 - Internet Access
 - DNS
 - NTP
 - DHCP

`node1`, running on Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB), for providing **kubernetes external services**:
  - Secret Management (Vault)
  - DNS Authoritative (Bind9)

A load balancer is also needed for providing Hight availability to Kubernetes API. In this cases a network load balancer, [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/), will be deployed in `node1` server.

For automating the OS installation of x86 nodes, a **PXE server** will be deployed in `node1` node.

**Ansible control node**, `pimaster` is deployed in a Linux VM or Linux Laptop, so from this node the whole cluster configuration can be managed. `pimaster` is connected to my home network (ip in  192.168.1.0/24 network). In `pimaster`, a IP route to 10.0.0.0/24 network through `gateway` (192.168.1.21) need to be configured, so it can have connectivity to cluster nodes.


## Hardware

### Nodes

#### x86-based old refurbished mini PC

- [HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Desktop mini PC](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-elitedesk-800-65w-g3-desktop-mini-pc/15497277/manuals)
  - CPU: Intel i5 6500T. 4 cores(4 threads) at 2.5 GHz
  - RAM: 16 GB

  ![hp-elitedesk-800](/assets/img/hp-elitedesk-800-g3.png)

  I have used the following hardware components

    - [3 x HP EliteDesk 800 G3 i5 6500T 2,5 GHz, 8 GB de RAM, SSD de 256 GB](https://www.amazon.es/HP-EliteDesk-800-G3-reacondicionado/dp/B09TL2N2M8) as x86 cluster nodes.

    - [3 x Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 2400MHz CL17 Memoria](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B01BIWKP58) as RAM expansion for mini PCs. Total memmory 16 GB

{{site.data.alerts.note}}

Initially the intent of this project was to build a kuberentes cluster using only Raspberry PI nodes. Due to Raspberry shortage happened during 2021-2023 period, which made impossible to buy them at reasonable prices, I decided to look for alternatives to be able to scale up my cluster.

Use old x86 refurbished mini PCs, with Intel i5 processors, was the solution. These mini PCs provide similar performance to RaspberryPi 4B's Quadcore ARM Cortex-A72, but its memory can be expanded up to 32GB of RAM (Raspberry PI 4B higher model only supports 8GB RAM). As a drawback power consumption of those mini PCs are higher that Raspberry PIs.

The overall price of a mini PC, intel i5 + 8 GB RAM + 256 GB SSD disk + power supply, ([aprox 130 €](https://www.amazon.es/HP-EliteDesk-800-G3-reacondicionado/dp/B09TL2N2M8/)) was cheaper than the overal cost of building a cluster node using a Rasbperry PI: cost of Raspberry PI 4B 8GB (100€) + Power Adapter (aprox 10 €) + SSD Disk ([aprox 20 €](https://www.amazon.es/Kingston-SSD-A400-Disco-s%C3%B3lido/dp/B01N5IB20Q)) + USB3.0 to SATA converter ([aprox 20€](https://www.amazon.es/Startech-USB3S2SAT3CB-Adaptador-3-0-2-5-negro/dp/B00HJZJI84))

Similar comparative exercice can be made using newer Raspberry Pi model. Raspberry Pi 5 based mode has a higher processor than Pi 4 model, Quadcore ARM Cortex-A76, and its higher model support 16 GB RAM. It also features a PCIe connector, higher SSD disk perfomace than USB sata converter

The overall cost to build a Raspberry Pi-5-based node for the kubernetes homelab cluster could be aprox 220€: [Raspberry PI-5 16GB](https://www.tiendatec.es/raspberry-pi/gama-raspberry-pi/2149-1386-raspberry-pi-5-16gb-8gb-4gb-2gb-modelo-b.html#/251-ram-16gb?src=raspberrypi) (144€), [Power Adapter](https://www.tiendatec.es/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-alimentacion/2150-1252-fuente-alimentacion-oficial-raspberry-pi-5-27w-pd-usb-c.html#/7-color-blanco?src=raspberrypi) (aprox 15€), [Active cooler](https://www.tiendatec.es/raspberry-pi/accesorios/2152-disipador-activo-oficial-raspberry-pi-5-5056561803357.html?src=raspberrypi)(aprox 6€) , [RTC Batery](https://www.tiendatec.es/raspberry-pi/accesorios/2153-bateria-rtc-oficial-raspberry-pi-5-8472496026895.html)(aprox 7€) , NVMe base + NVMe 256GB disk (50€), i.e [Piromori NVMe base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/nvme-base?variant=41219587178579) + NVMe disk

As alternative a overall price of refurbished mini PC, intel i5, 16GB RAM + 256 GB NVME disk + power supply, [aprox 150], [base model](https://www.amazon.es/HP-EliteDesk-800-G3-reacondicionado/dp/B09TL2N2M8/)(aprox 130 €) + 8GB RAM expansion(aprox. 20 €).

### Networking

A 16 GE ports LAN switch, [D-Link DGS-1016S](https://www.dlink.com/en/products/dgs-1016s-16-port-gigabit-unmanaged-switch) is used to provide connectivity to all cluster nodes (Raspberry Pis and x86 mini PCs).

All nodes are connected to the switch with Cat6 eth cables, using their Gigabit Ethernet port.

![dlink-dgs-1016S](/assets/img/dlink-dgs-1016S.png)

As homelab router/firewall, a wifi pocket-sized travel router, [GL-Inet Slate Plus (GL-A1300)](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-a1300/). Firmware of the router is replaced by latest version of OpenWRT operating system.

![glinet-xlate-plus](/assets/img/glinet-xlate-plus.png)

One of the LAN ports of GL-A1300 is connected to DL-Link switch. One of the WiFi ports is used as WAN port connected to my Home network.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}

As alternative to Gl-iNet router, a Raspberry Pi 4B can be used.

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For networking, I have used the following hardware components:

- [1 x D-Link DGS-1016S](https://www.amazon.es/D-Link-Gigabit-met%C3%A1lica-sobremesa-Ventiladores/dp/B08GYJ13XG). 16 ports GE ethernet unmanaged switch

- [1 x GL-Inet Slate Plus (GL-A1300)](https://www.amazon.es/GL-iNet-GL-A1300-Slate-Enrutador-inal%C3%A1mbrico/dp/B0B4ZSR2PX), wifi router/firewall.

- [10 x Ethernet Cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32821735352.html). Flat Cat 6,  15 cm length

## Raspberry PI Storage

x86 mini PCs has their own integrated disk (SSD disk or NVME). For Raspberry PIs different storage alternatives can be applied:

- Dedicated Disks: Each node has its SSD disks attached to one of its USB 3.0 ports. SSD disk + SATA to USB 3.0 adapter is needed for each node.
- Centralized SAN: Each node has Flash Disk (USB3.0) for running OS and additional storage capacity is provide via iSCSI from a SAN (Storage Area Network). One of the cluster nodes, `san`, is configured as SAN server, and it needs to have SSD disk attached to its USB3.0 port.

![pi-cluster-rpi4-storage](/assets/img/pi-cluster-rpi4-storage.png)


### Dedicated Disks

`gateway` uses local storage attached directly to USB 3.0 port (Flash Disk) for hosting the OS, avoiding the use of less reliable SDCards.

For having better cluster performance all Raspberry PI nodes will use SSDs attached to USB 3.0 port. SSD disk will be used to host OS (boot from USB) and to provide the additional storage required per node for deploying the Kubernetes distributed storage solution (Ceph or Longhorn).

![pi-cluster-HW-2.0](/assets/img/pi-cluster-2.0.png)


### Centralized SAN

A cheaper alternative architecture, instead of using dedicated SSD disks for each cluster node, one single SSD disk can be used for configuring a SAN service.

Each raspberry pi in the cluster node can use local storage attached directly to USB 3.0 port (USB Flash Disk) for hosting the OS, avoiding the use of less reliable SDCards.

As additional storage (required by distributed storage solution), iSCSI SAN can be deployed instead of attaching an additional USB Flash Disks to each of the nodes.

A SAN (Storage Access Network) can be configured using one of the nodes, `san` node, as iSCSI Storage Server, providing additional storage (LUNs) to the rest of the Raspberry PI nodes.

As storage device, a SSD disk was attached to `san` node. This SSD disk was used as well to host the OS.

![pi-cluster-HW-1.0](/assets/img/pi-cluster.png)

This alternative setup is worth it from educational point of view, to test the different storage options for RaspberryPI and to learn about iSCSI configuration and deployment on bare-metal environments. As well it can be used as a cheaper solution for deploying centralized storage solution.

See [SAN configuration document](/docs/san/) further details about the configuration of SAN using a Raspeberry PIs, `san`, as iSCSI Target exposing LUNs to cluster nodes.


### Raspberry PI Storage benchmarking

Different Raspberry PI storage configurations have been tested:

1. Internal SDCard: [SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Memory Cards](https://www.amazon.es/SanDisk-SDSQUA4-064G-GN6MA-microSDXC-Adaptador-Rendimiento-dp-B08GY9NYRM/dp/B08GY9NYRM) (Class 10)

2. Flash Disk USB 3.0: [Samsung USB 3.1 32 GB Fit Plus Flash Disk](https://www.amazon.es/Samsung-FIT-Plus-Memoria-MUF-32AB/dp/B07HPWKS3C)

3. SSD Disk [Kingston A400 480GB](https://www.amazon.es/Kingston-SSD-A400-Disco-s%C3%B3lido/dp/B01N0TQPQB) + USB3 to SATA Adapter [Startech USB 3.0 to SATA III](https://www.amazon.es/Startech-USB3S2SAT3CB-Adaptador-3-0-2-5-negro/dp/B00HJZJI84)

4. iSCSI Volumes. Using another Raspberry PI as storage server, configured as iSCSI Target, using a SSD disk attached.

#### Testing procedure

Sequential and random I/O tests have been executed with the different storage configurations.

For the testing a tweaked version of the script provided by James A. Chambers (https://jamesachambers.com/) has been used

Tests execution has been automated with Ansible. See `pi-storage-benchmark` [repository](https://github.com/ricsanfre/pi-storage-benchmark) for the details of the testing procedure and the results.

##### Sequential I/O performance

Test sequential I/O with `dd` and `hdparam` tools. `hdparm` can be installed through `sudo apt install -y hdparm`


- Read speed (Use `hdparm` command)

  ```shell
  sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda1

  Timing buffered disk reads:  72 MB in  3.05 seconds =  23.59 MB/sec

  sudo hdparm -T /dev/sda1
  Timing cached reads:   464 MB in  2.01 seconds = 231.31 MB/sec
  ```

  It can be combined in just one command:

  ```shell
  sudo hdparm -tT --direct /dev/sda1

  Timing O_DIRECT cached reads:   724 MB in  2.00 seconds = 361.84 MB/sec
  Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 406 MB in  3.01 seconds = 134.99 MB/sec
  ```

- Write Speed (use `dd` command)

  ```shell
  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=4k count=80k conv=fsync

  81920+0 records in
  81920+0 records out
  335544320 bytes (336 MB, 320 MiB) copied, 1,86384 s, 180 MB/s
  ```

##### Random I/O Performance

Tools used `fio` and `iozone`.

- Install required packages with:

  ```shell
  sudo apt install iozone3 fio
  ```

- Check random I/O with `fio`

  Random Write

  ```shell
  sudo fio --minimal --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=test --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --size=80M --readwrite=randwrite
   ```

  Random Read

  ```shell
  sudo fio --minimal --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=test --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --size=80M --readwrite=randread
   ```

- Check random I/O with `iozone`

  ```shell
  sudo iozone -a -e -I -i 0 -i 1 -i 2 -s 80M -r 4k
  ```

Conclusions:

1. Clearly `SSD` with USB3.0 to SATA adapter beats the rest in all performance tests.
2. `SDCard` obtains worst metrics than `FlashDisk` and `iSCSI`
3. `FlashDisk` and `iSCSI` get similar performance metrics

The performace obtained using local attached USB3.0 Flash Disk is quite similar to the one obtained using iSCSI with RaspberryPI+SSD Disk as central storage.
