# Lab Architecture and Hardware used

## Lab Architecture

The home lab I am building is shown in the following picture

## Networking

A Raspberry Pi cluster composed of 4 Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB), `node1-node4` will be connected using a LAN Switch. To isolate lab network from my home network, a Raspberry PI 4 (2GB), `gateway` will be used as Router/Firewall of the lab network. It will also provide networking sercices: Internet Access, DNS, NTP and DHCP services to my lab network. `gateway` will be connected to my home network using its WIFI interface and to the LAN Switch using the eth interface.

## Storage

`node1-node4` will use local storage attached directly to USB 3.0 port (USB Flash Disk) for hosting the OS, avoiding the use of less reliable SDCards.

Additional storage is required per node for deploying the Kubernetes distributed storage solution (Ceph or Longhorn).

iSCSI SAN will be deployed instead of attaching an additional USB Flash Disks to each of the nodes because, first, I wanted to test the different storage options for RaspberryPI and to learn about iSCSI configuration and deployment on bare-metal environments, and second, deploying a centralized storage solution was cheaper than installing additional USB Flash Disks.

After testing the performance of the different storage options for the Raspberry Pi, the performace obtained using local attached USB3.0 Flash Disk is quite simillar to the one obtained using iSCSI with a SSD Disk as central storage). See this [repository](https://github.com/ricsanfre/pi-storage-benchmark) for the details of the testing procedure and the results.

A SAN (Storage Access Network) will be configured using `gateway` as iSCSI Storage Server, providing additional storage (LUNs) to `node1-node4`.
As storage device, a SSD disk will be attached to `gateway` node. This SSD disk will be used as well to host the OS.
