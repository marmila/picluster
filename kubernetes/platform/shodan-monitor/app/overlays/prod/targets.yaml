# My Assets Configuration - Production
#
# IMPORTANT: Shodan Monitor API (Up to 16 IPs - NO Credits!)
# ==============================================================
# Your Shodan Membership plan includes Monitor API for up to 16 IPs.
# Monitor API does NOT consume query credits - it's FREE for those 16 IPs!
#
# Recommendation:
# - First 16 assets: Use Shodan Monitor API (0 credits)
# - Additional assets: Use Host API (1 credit per lookup)
#
# CREDIT BUDGETING GUIDE:
# =======================
# With Shodan Membership Plan (100 query credits/month):
# - Monitor API: Up to 16 IPs = 0 credits/month ✅
# - Host API: Each IP lookup = 1 query credit
# - Recommended budget: 40-55 credits/month for additional assets
#   (assuming 18 intelligence profiles using 54 credits/month)
#
# Interval Recommendations:
# - Critical production assets: 6-12 hours
# - Important assets: 12-24 hours
# - Standard assets: 24 hours
# - Low-priority assets: 48+ hours

# Notes:
# - Monitor API (first 16 IPs): NO query credits consumed - FREE!
# - Host API (additional IPs): Each IP lookup = 1 query credit
# - monitor_interval_hours: For Host API, determines check frequency
#                          For Monitor API, Shodan controls scan frequency
# - Tags are used for filtering and organization in the UI
# - Research targets are intentionally vulnerable/exposed systems for learning
