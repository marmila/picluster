# My Assets Configuration
#
# 🎯 IMPORTANT: Shodan Monitor API (Up to 16 IPs - NO Credits!)
# ==============================================================
# Your Shodan Membership plan includes Monitor API for up to 16 IPs.
# Monitor API does NOT consume query credits - it's FREE for those 16 IPs!
#
# Recommendation:
# - First 16 assets: Use Shodan Monitor API (0 credits)
# - Additional assets: Use Host API (1 credit per lookup)
#
# CREDIT BUDGETING GUIDE:
# =======================
# With Shodan Membership Plan (100 query credits/month):
# - Monitor API: Up to 16 IPs = 0 credits/month ✅
# - Host API: Each IP lookup = 1 query credit
# - Recommended budget: 40-55 credits/month for additional assets
#   (assuming 18 intelligence profiles using 54 credits/month)
#
# Credit Calculation Examples:
# - 10 assets @ 12h interval = 10 × 60 checks/month = 60 credits/month
# - 15 assets @ 24h interval = 15 × 30 checks/month = 45 credits/month
# - 20 assets @ 24h interval = 20 × 30 checks/month = 60 credits/month
#
# Interval Recommendations:
# - Critical production assets: 6-12 hours
# - Important assets: 12-24 hours
# - Standard assets: 24 hours
# - Low-priority assets: 48+ hours
#
my_assets:
  # ============================================
  # TIER 1: Critical Assets (Use Monitor API - First 16 IPs)
  # These should be set up in Shodan Monitor for 0 credits
  # ============================================
  
  # Example: Critical production server (Monitor API - 0 credits)
  - ip: "192.0.2.1"
    name: "Production API Server"
    description: "Main API endpoint for production"
    tags: [production, critical, monitor_api]
    monitor_interval_hours: 6  # Monitor API handles scanning automatically
    # Credit cost: 0/month (uses Monitor API - first 16 IPs are free!)

  # Example: Important staging environment (Monitor API - 0 credits)
  - ip: "198.51.100.10"
    name: "Staging Server"
    description: "Staging environment for testing"
    tags: [staging, monitor_api]
    monitor_interval_hours: 12  # Monitor API handles scanning
    # Credit cost: 0/month (uses Monitor API)

  # Example: Home lab (Monitor API - 0 credits)
  - ip: "203.0.113.5"
    name: "Home Lab"
    description: "Personal homelab infrastructure"
    tags: [homelab, monitor_api]
    monitor_interval_hours: 24  # Monitor API handles scanning
    # Credit cost: 0/month (uses Monitor API)

  # ============================================
  # TIER 2: Additional Assets (Use Host API - Consumes Credits)
  # Assets beyond the first 16 use Host API (1 credit per lookup)
  # ============================================
  
  # Example: Additional asset (Host API - consumes credits)
  # - ip: "203.0.113.6"
  #   name: "Development Server"
  #   description: "Internal dev server"
  #   tags: [development, host_api]
  #   monitor_interval_hours: 48  # Check every 2 days
  #   # Credit cost: ~15/month (uses Host API - beyond 16 IP limit)

# Notes:
# - Monitor API (first 16 IPs): NO query credits consumed - FREE!
# - Host API (additional IPs): Each IP lookup = 1 query credit
# - monitor_interval_hours: For Host API, determines check frequency
#                          For Monitor API, Shodan controls scan frequency
# - Tags are used for filtering and organization in the UI
# - Assets are tracked over time for change detection and alerts
# - The system automatically skips checks if an asset was recently checked
# - Priority: Use Monitor API for your 16 most critical assets
#
# Setup Monitor API:
# 1. First 16 assets in this file will use Monitor API (0 credits)
# 2. Set up Monitor alerts in Shodan or use the API to create them
# 3. Configure webhook endpoint to receive Monitor notifications
# 4. See SHODAN_MONITOR_API_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
