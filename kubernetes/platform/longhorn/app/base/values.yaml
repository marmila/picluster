defaultSettings:
  # Where Longhorn stores data on each node
  defaultDataPath: "/storage"

  # Limit how much rebuild/restore work a single node does in parallel.
  # This reduces CPU spikes from replica rebuilds and volume restores,
  # at the cost of slower recovery when many volumes need work.
  concurrentReplicaRebuildPerNodeLimit: 1
  concurrentVolumeBackupRestorePerNodeLimit: 1

  # Avoid aggressive fast-rebuild behavior; prefer lower background churn.
